# AI Workload Manager

This project is a beginner-friendly platform for managing and tracking AI training tasks. 

### ðŸ§  What does this mean?

Think of it like this:
- When companies train AI models (like ChatGPT), they need to **monitor**, **start**, **stop**, and **manage** those training tasks.
- This project is like a **dashboard** and **backend system** that helps developers manage those AI jobs more easily.

### ðŸ“¦ What Youâ€™ll Find in This Project:
- A backend system built with **FastAPI** (a Python framework).
- A way to create, update, and view training jobs (called "workloads").
- A structured layout for future things like real-time updates, metrics, or dashboards.

### ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?
This is part of my personal journey to:
- Learn how to build developer platforms
- Understand backend development better
- Explore how AI infrastructure works

Even though itâ€™s a technical project, Iâ€™m writing this README in plain English so anyone curious about AI or tech can follow along.

Stay tuned as I build this step-by-step and update this repo regularly ðŸš€
